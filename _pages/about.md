First organized in 2004 by Rachel Altman and Jason Loeppky, the Vancouver Joint Statistics Seminar provides a valuable opportunity for statistics and actuarial science students at SFU and UBC to attend a seminar with accessible talks, network with peers, and hear from leading faculty and industry researchers about a variety of topics. It is held twice a year, with the Fall seminar organized by the students at SFU and the Spring seminar organized by the students at UBC.

This seminar would not be possible without PIMS and the SFU Graduate Student Society, and we thank them for their support.
